    <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

    <div class='demo'>

      <!-- TODO: FILL IN YOUR DESCRIPTION -->
      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo! It was created as a web-based film
      as a collaboration between Danger Mouse, Danielle Luipi, Jack White
      and Nora Jones for their song Black from the Rome Project in 2011.The
      interactive WebGL based experience lets users control the experience.
      RO.ME is made up of three distinct dreams and has been made entirely
      via coding. It allows the users to move around and striking visuals,
      and graphics welcomes them. It is the first of its kind web-based
      project and was revolutionary in showing how 3D graphics and webGL
      can create hyperrealistic visuals and an interactive experience. What
      sets this project apart is its combination of 2D and 3D graphics to
      create a project that runs entirely on the web utilizing the GPU of the
      host computer and can be run of any computer with the computing power,
      a revolutionary feature that was introduced by WebGL.

      <p id='technology'>
      <h2> Technology: </h2>
      
      The primary technology used in the development of RO.ME is 3js and WebGL as confirmed in
      the technology page as well as using the console in the web developer tools (Confirmed twice for
      fun once in Chrome and once in Safari) .3WebGL.js was noticed extensively in the Console while RO.ME was running
      confirming the use of WebGL and 3js. Furthermore HTML 5 was used in creating the foundation and CSS was used for
      styling (both found by looking at the Code in Web Development tools as well as the Elements and Console Tab).

      The Contra Project Rate Hiring Calculator and RO.ME: 3 Dreams of Black both run in a web browser and uses Web GL, but their interfaces and purposes are very
      different. The Contra calculator has a clean and minimalistic, view which looks more like a business design. The colors are not as vibrant and the images are more
      resembling of simple icons. It's efficient and optimized for working properly  since it's clear and easy to use. On the other hand, RO.ME is a music video with real
      time rendering of 3d elements that its interactive, full of imaginary, and with so many options for the user to engage with visually and with the track pad of my
      laptop.

      <h2> Significance (AI): </h2><!-- TODO: SUMMARIZE THE AI OUTPUT -->
      
      RO.ME: 3 Dreams of Black was a landmark WebGL project that redefined what the browser could do, becoming the first interactive film built with real time 3D graphics,
      2D animation, and video running seamlessly without plugins. Released as part of Google's Chrome Experiments, it let users steer through surreal dream worlds,
      interact with objects, and even contribute creations to others experiences blurring the line between viewer and participant. More than just a demo, it shared
      open source tools and code, inspiring developers to explore WebGLs potential. With millions of views, critical acclaim, and major creative awards, RO.ME proved the
      web could be a powerful medium for immersive, cinematic storytelling and set the stage for the next generation of interactive web experiences. <br><br>
